# Dear Players,

We would like to inform you that the server has undergone a **Map Wipe** following the latest update.

🛠️ Reason:
 - This was due to Rust’s monthly update, during which the game developers at Facepunch enforce a **Forced Wipe** on all servers. This ensures compatibility with new systems and features introduced in the game. This is standard practice and occurs **on the first Thursday of every month**.

🙏 We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and the loss of bases or player-built structures. We truly understand the effort and time you've invested.

Rest assured, we will use this incident to improve how we schedule future __Full Wipes__ and __Map Wipes__, aiming to prevent unexpected occurrences like this.

Thank you for your understanding. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to the admin team at any time.
