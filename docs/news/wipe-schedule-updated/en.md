# Dear Rusthai players,

The Rusthai Community team would like to inform all players about an important change to the server Wipe Map cycle.

After careful consideration, we have decided to cancel the semi-monthly Wipe Map from now on.

This decision is based on an assessment of the situation and the responsibilities of each team member. With heavy work and daily responsibilities, as well as pressures from the environment and ill-wishers, these things have had a significant impact and may have affected some of their mental health. In addition, the Rusthai Community is a small community that operates without profit, with only support from players through the Buy me a coffee channel. Each team member has their own responsibilities and life paths to take care of. Carrying out the semi-monthly Wipe Map has become too much of a burden for the team in the current situation.

Therefore, in order for the team to manage their time and resources sustainably and continue to provide services to the server, we need to change this policy.

From now on, only Force Wipes from the game developer (Facepunch) will occur.

And there will still be a daily Automatic Server Restart at 04:50 AM Thailand time for server stability as usual.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this change and would like to thank all players for understanding the situation and supporting the Rusthai Community team all along. üôè Your understanding and support are truly our greatest encouragement.

Thank you.

Rusthai Community Team
