# Challenging Rust World

Rust is known to be one of the most popular games among people who love base building and fighting in a friendly yet challenging world. But playing on user-run servers is often a different experience than playing on official servers. With more peer and amazing battles due to its resemblance to the real world with other players, there can be endless corruption and competition.
