# ðŸ’Œ To all survivors!

We have some exciting news! We have completed a major server infrastructure migration to a more modern and stable system! This upgrade is ready to deliver a smoother, faster, and better experience than ever before!

To build on this new system, in the upcoming Full Wiped, we have prepared some major changes to make your Rust experience more fun and intense:

 - **Map size reduced**
    From 4500-6000 blocks to 3000-4000 blocks. This decision was made based on our understanding that as a growing community, having a map that is too large can be lonely and boring to find other survivors. This reduction will increase player density, making encounters more frequent and exciting!

 - **Shared Blueprint With Team Leader Removal**
    We are going back to the essence of Rust in its original Vanilla form! Removing Shared Blueprint will make learning and developing more challenging and rewarding for individual players and teams in a classic way.

Please note that during these changes, there may be some minor tweaks to make everything perfect for everyone. Don't forget to follow our news and announcements closely!
