## Chat Log Analysis: Team Alliance Diagnosis

**Server:** Rust (Group Limit = 8 Players)
**Teams in Question:**
* **Team 1 (7 Players):** ShiboSan, John McDonie Binayug, John Donie BinaYuGiOh, John Donie Binahyuga, Asian, PatientZero, Anchzxc
* **Team 2 (3 Players):** 00Pew_Nani_Gunz00, dreckieee, Yomommy

**Inquiry:** Are these two teams potentially allied, effectively forming a group of 10 players and thus exceeding the server's group limit?

**Analysis Results:**

Based on the provided chat logs, there is **strong evidence suggesting an alliance or friendly relationship** between Team 1 and Team 2. While they might not be formally grouped within the game system at the same time, their coordinated actions point towards exceeding the spirit of the 8-player group limit.

**Supporting Evidence:**

1.  **Friendly and Cooperative Conversation (27/04/2025 ~23:21 onwards):**
    * After Team 2 (led by Yomommy) was raided and lost resources (e.g., 50+ rockets) to another player/group (HALO) at Z24, members of Team 1 (John McDonie Binayug, PatientZero, John Donie De lata, John Donie BinaYuGiOh, John Donie BinaHyuga, ShiboSan) engaged with Team 2 (Yomommy, 00Pew_Nani_Gunz00) in the General Chat.
    * Team 2 provided intel and encouraged Team 1 to raid the Z24 base that had attacked them, mentioning abundant loot and advising them to act quickly.
    * Team 1 expressed intent to retaliate ("paghihigante namin kayo" - we will avenge you, "itatry lang namin ata mamaya" - we'll try later) and stated their team size as 7.
    * Team 2 shared tactical details about the enemy ("isa lang nagbubuhat don" - only one is carrying them, "andun pa rocket panigurado" - the rockets are likely still there) and offered advice ("Paliguhan nyu ng bomba dun. Wag nyu lang pagamit yung rockets namin hahaha para may loots pa rin kaung maganda dun" - Bombard them. Just don't let them use our rockets, haha, so there's still good loot left).
    * The conversation between the two teams was positive and indicated collaboration against a common enemy.

2.  **Team Size Confirmation:**
    * Team 1 confirmed multiple times they had 7 members.
    * Team 2 confirmed they had 3 members.

3.  **Engagement with Common Enemy:**
    * On 28/04/2025, Team 1 (7 players) engaged in extensive combat and verbal confrontation with player HALO (likely the same entity that raided Team 2 at Z24). Although Team 2's direct involvement wasn't observed *at that moment*, the prior coordination strongly implies an ongoing alliance.

4.  **Awareness of Group Limit Rules:**
    * A discussion about the Group Limit occurred between Team 1 and HALO. Team 1 correctly stated the limit was 8, while HALO claimed it was 4. This indicates Team 1 was aware of the server rule.

**Additional Notes:**

* The fact that Team 2 members are not Steam friends with Team 1 does not preclude an in-game alliance.
* The combined actions of both teams (totaling 10 players) in sharing information and targeting a common enemy effectively circumvent the intention of the Group Limit = 8 rule.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the chat log evidence, it is highly probable that **Team 1 (7 players) and Team 2 (3 players) are operating under an alliance.** They coordinated and assisted each other against a common enemy, demonstrating behavior consistent with exceeding the server's 8-player group limit rule.
